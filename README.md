1. Generate a population of artefacts
2. Display phenotypes (e.g. paintings) and genotypes (feature points)
3. Let user select the best phenotype
4. Place a gaussian distribution at best phenotype
5. Score population considering gaussian weight
6. Select population based on fitness
7. Go to step 2 and loop forever
